# LAB-INTAKE-001 — Legacy System Intake & Assessment

## Ticket Information
- **Date:** December 16, 2025
- **Author:** Phillip Bridgeman
- **Category:** Asset Management / Hardware Intake
- **Environment:** Home Lab — Legacy System
- **Status:** Completed

## Purpose / Context
This lab documents the intake and assessment of a legacy desktop system prior to integrating it into a home lab environment.

The goal was to establish a documented baseline of hardware, operating system state, and suitability for non-production testing, mirroring real-world IT asset intake and evaluation workflows.

## Reported Scenario
> “A legacy system needs to be evaluated and prepared for use in a controlled lab environment.”

## Diagnostic / Assessment Steps

### Step 1 — Hardware Inventory
- Identified CPU, RAM, and storage devices
- Documented expansion ports and peripherals
- Verified BIOS/UEFI access

**Evidence:**
- Front and rear chassis photos (`evidence/photo-01-front.jpg`)
- BIOS summary screenshot (`evidence/screenshot-bios.png`)

## Findings
- System is functional and powers on reliably
- Hardware is suitable for legacy OS testing
- Limited RAM and CPU restrict modern workloads
- Not appropriate for production or multi-user use

## Root Cause
N/A — Planned intake and evaluation activity.

## Resolution
System approved for controlled use within the home lab for non-production testing and troubleshooting exercises.

## Verification
- System passed POST and basic diagnostics
- Inventory documentation completed
- No critical hardware faults identified during intake

## Notes / Lessons Learned
- Structured intake prevents wasted effort later
- Legacy hardware remains valuable for troubleshooting practice
- Early documentation simplifies future changes and audits
