# LAB-INTAKE-001 — Legacy System Intake & Assessment

## Ticket Information
- **Title:** Legacy System Intake
- **Date:** December 16, 2025
- **Author:** Phillip Bridgeman
- **Category:** Asset Management / Hardware Intake
- **Priority:** Low
- **Environment:** Home Lab — Legacy System
- **Status:** Completed

---

## Purpose / Context
A legacy system was acquired for use within the home lab environment.  
This lab documents the **initial intake, assessment, and planning** process prior to repurposing the system for learning and testing scenarios.

This mirrors real-world IT workflows used when onboarding older hardware into test, training, or non-production environments.

---

## Reported Scenario
> “A legacy system needs to be evaluated and prepared for use within a controlled lab environment.”

---

## Scope
- Single legacy desktop system
- Non-production use
- Intended for OS testing, troubleshooting practice, and compatibility evaluation

---

## Diagnostic / Assessment Steps

### Step 1 — Hardware Inventory
- Recorded CPU model and architecture
- Documented RAM capacity and configuration
- Identified storage devices (type, size, interface)
- Noted expansion cards and peripherals
- Verified BIOS/UEFI availability and settings

### Step 2 — Operating System Assessment
- Identified installed OS and version
- Checked activation status (if applicable)
- Reviewed system update status
- Noted installed drivers and device manager warnings

### Step 3 — Compatibility Review
- Assessed suitability for:
  - Windows reinstallation
  - Linux installation
  - Virtualization support (if any)
- Identified hardware limitations impacting modern OS support

### Step 4 — Data Protection
- Identified any existing data on storage devices
- Planned full backup or secure wipe prior to reuse

---

## Findings
- System is functional and suitable for controlled lab use
- Hardware limitations identified and documented
- Not suitable for production or modern enterprise workloads
- Appropriate for legacy OS testing and troubleshooting exercises

---

## Root Cause
N/A — Planned intake and evaluation activity.

---

## Corrective / Preventive Actions
- Documented full system specifications
- Defined acceptable use cases within the home lab
- Scheduled OS reinstall or reconfiguration
- Planned backup and data sanitation steps
- Flagged hardware constraints for future labs

---

## Resolution
Legacy system approved for integration into the home lab environment for non-production testing and learning purposes.

---

## Verification
- System successfully powered on and passed basic POST checks
- Inventory documentation completed and stored in lab records
- No critical hardware faults detected during intake

---

## Notes / Lessons Learned
- Performing structured intake prevents wasted effort later
- Legacy hardware is valuable for troubleshooting practice
- Clear documentation helps determine realistic use cases
- Intake documentation provides a baseline for future changes
